This is an inventory manager created by **@andersonaddo** and **@Ogoe1** for a small local chemical shop in Ghana.  Even though it was made for a specific shop, with some modification, it can work for many businesses!

This is a JavaFX application linked with SQLite through Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).
For all those who want to edit the codebase, this was made in Netbeans!
